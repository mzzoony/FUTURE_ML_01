# Getting Started with Your ML Internship

Welcome to your Machine Learning internship repository! This guide will help you get started with your projects.

## Week 1: Foundation Setup ✅

- [x] Repository created and structured
- [x] Development environment ready
- [ ] Python environment configured
- [ ] Dependencies installed
- [ ] First "Hello ML" notebook created

## Week 2-4: Project Development

As you work through your internship, follow these steps for each project:

### 1. Planning Phase
- Define the problem statement
- Identify dataset sources
- Outline the approach
- Set success metrics

### 2. Data Phase
- Collect/download data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Clean and preprocess data
- Engineer features if needed

### 3. Modeling Phase
- Select appropriate algorithms
- Train baseline models
- Tune hyperparameters
- Evaluate performance

### 4. Documentation Phase
- Document findings
- Create visualizations
- Write project README
- Prepare presentation (if needed)

## Best Practices

### Git Workflow
```bash
# Before starting work
git pull origin main

# Create a new branch for each project
git checkout -b project/project-name

# Make changes, then commit
git add .
git commit -m "Descriptive message"

# Push changes
git push origin project/project-name
```

### Jupyter Notebooks
- Use descriptive names with dates
- Clear outputs before committing
- Add markdown explanations
- Include conclusions

### Code Quality
- Write clean, readable code
- Add docstrings and comments
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Test your functions

### Data Management
- Never commit large files (> 10 MB)
- Use .gitignore for data files
- Provide download links for datasets
- Document data sources

## Project Ideas

Here are some project ideas for your internship:

1. **Classification**: Iris flower classification, spam detection, sentiment analysis
2. **Regression**: House price prediction, sales forecasting
3. **Clustering**: Customer segmentation, image compression
4. **Computer Vision**: Digit recognition (MNIST), image classification
5. **NLP**: Text classification, topic modeling

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic models before trying complex ones
2. **Document Everything**: Your future self will thank you
3. **Version Control**: Commit regularly with meaningful messages
4. **Ask Questions**: Don't hesitate to seek help when stuck
5. **Share Progress**: Update your README and document learnings
6. **Iterate**: ML is iterative - keep improving your models
7. **Visualize**: Always visualize your data and results

## Weekly Checklist

- [ ] Complete at least one notebook per week
- [ ] Document learnings in docs/
- [ ] Update project README files
- [ ] Commit changes regularly
- [ ] Review and refactor code
- [ ] Explore new ML techniques
