# Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for experiments, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and prototyping.

## Organization

Notebooks are organized by:
- **Exploratory Analysis:** Data exploration and visualization
- **Experiments:** Model testing and hyperparameter tuning
- **Tutorials:** Learning notebooks and practice exercises

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive names with dates:
- `YYYY-MM-DD-topic-name.ipynb`
- Example: `2024-01-15-iris-classification.ipynb`

## Best Practices

- Add markdown cells to explain your thought process
- Include visualizations and insights
- Keep notebooks focused on specific tasks
- Document findings and conclusions
- Clear output before committing (to reduce file size)
