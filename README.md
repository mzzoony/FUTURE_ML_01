# FUTURE_ML_01 - Machine Learning Internship

Welcome to my Machine Learning Internship repository at Future Interns! This repository contains all projects, assignments, and learning materials from my one-month ML internship program.

## 📋 About the Internship

This repository is part of my Machine Learning internship at Future Interns, where I'll be working on various ML projects and building practical skills in:
- Machine Learning algorithms and techniques
- Data preprocessing and analysis
- Model development and evaluation
- Deep Learning frameworks
- Real-world ML applications

**Duration:** 1 Month
